# Tutorials

The following tutorials assumes knowledge of how to interact with files in a command line environment. Otherwise, basic Linux skills and an understanding of Python syntax will be an asset. 

## Flat YAML

The most common use case for this software will be to generate configuration for a flat file of configuration options. In this case, there are many parameters, each with a name, and a value. See below for a minimal example.

```yaml
#' Here is some meta data.
meta: "Data"

#' And here is 
#' some more
#' split over
#' a couple of lines.
fun: True
```

Each value has a name, a colon, and a value. Above each value we have given meta data in a comment with a specific prefix `#'`. This can be whatever character you want, so long as it is consistent. You can give different prefix characters with the `-c` flag. 

To create a report from this file, point `yamldoc` to it.

```sh
yamldoc test/yaml/basic.yaml
```

Which gives

Notice how `yamldoc` intelligently joins and wraps long comments to fit inside the table. In later tutorials, we will see how to extend this and automatically embed the results in Sphinx documentation.
