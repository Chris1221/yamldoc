1. Read in a schema file for additional information on the data; i.e. what format it needs to be to be accepted. 
2. Formatting needs to be nicer. Section headings have to be more than just the name. Could these be tables within 
   the groupings? Have each element be an entry in a table?
  - If so, could output each Entry as essentially | {entry.key} | {entry.value} | {entry.meta} | and then 
    have the beginnings and ends of the tables at the beginning and end.
  - If schema, add an extra column for type. Really this could be in the meta with a tag. Maybe better 
    to keep it in schema though, since the purpose is to not duplicate information.
